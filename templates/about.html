                <h2>üî¨ How It Works</h2>
                <p>Our prediction model is powered by a <strong>Random Forest algorithm</strong>, trained on comprehensive real estate data. The model analyzes 10 critical property features to generate accurate price predictions:</p>
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li><strong>Overall Quality (1-10):</strong> Material and finish quality rating of the property</li>
                    <li><strong>Above Grade Living Area:</strong> Living space above ground level in square feet</li>
                    <li><strong>Garage Capacity:</strong> Number of cars the garage can accommodate</li>
                    <li><strong>Garage Area:</strong> Total garage square footage</li>
                    <li><strong>First Floor Area:</strong> Square footage of the first floor</li>
                    <li><strong>Total Basement Area:</strong> Complete basement square footage</li>
                    <li><strong>Lot Area:</strong> Total property lot size</li>
                    <li><strong>Finished Basement:</strong> Type 1 finished basement area</li>
                    <li><strong>Full Bathrooms:</strong> Number of complete bathrooms above grade</li>
                    <li><strong>Years Since Remodel:</strong> Time elapsed since last major renovation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These features undergo advanced preprocessing including log transformations, scaling, and imputation before being fed into our trained Random Forest model for optimal prediction accuracy.</p>
